# General description 

This folder will contain links to solutions to Professor Patrick Lee's problem sets from when he taught the class in 2009. The problem sets 
themselves may be found here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-512-theory-of-solids-ii-spring-2009/pages/assignments/


## Problem set solutions: 

**Fluctuation/dissipation theorem and part of Problem set 1**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HyE7sOBPJe 

**Notes on EELS**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/r1FlakUvkl (includes derivations of equations in the original paper by Frohlich).

**Problem set 2, question 2a, b thorough discussion**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/r1UF4xoIJx (Goes well beyond the problem, including a discussion of local field effects).

**Problem set 4 solutions**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/rk_8fsNSJe (Derivation of conductivity in the Boltzmann and Kubo formalisms, discussion of Kramers-Kronig
relations, conductivity in the small and large mean free path regimes, derivation of Kubo formula from Fermi's golden rule). 

**Mathematical aside relevant to problem set 6**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/Bywoh-QIkl These notes go through the derivation of an integral used to find the static 
orbital magnetic susceptibility. There is also a discussion about a typo in the book by Grosso...
