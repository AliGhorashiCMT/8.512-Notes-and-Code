# General description 

This folder will contain links to solutions to Professor Patrick Lee's problem sets from when he taught the class in 2009. The problem sets 
themselves may be found here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-512-theory-of-solids-ii-spring-2009/pages/assignments/


## Problem set solutions: 

**Fluctuation/dissipation theorem and part of Problem set 1**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HyE7sOBPJe 

**Neutron scattering**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HJ3xxUaDye

**Notes on EELS (Problem set 2, question 1)**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/r1FlakUvkl (includes derivations of equations in the original paper by Frohlich). Mean free path, EELS spectrum in the classical and quantum formulations. Comparison of real space vs momentum space cutoffs in the classical formulation. Application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. 

**Problem set 2, question 2a, b thorough discussion**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/r1UF4xoIJx (Goes well beyond the problem, including a discussion of local field effects).

**Problem set 4 solutions**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/rk_8fsNSJe (Derivation of conductivity in the Boltzmann and Kubo formalisms, discussion of Kramers-Kronig
relations, conductivity in the small and large mean free path regimes, derivation of Kubo formula from Fermi's golden rule). 

**Mathematical aside relevant to problem set 6**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/Bywoh-QIkl These notes go through the derivation of an integral used to find the static 
orbital magnetic susceptibility. There is also a discussion about a typo in the book by Grosso...

**Problem set 6 solutions**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/ryLZ2ohr1g 

**Longitudinal vector potentials as gauge transformations**: Relevant to problem set 6, where the response to a transverse vector potential is calculated. https://hackmd.io/@aligho/B12odkXF1e, explicit calculation for the free electron gas: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/r1bMPlVFyx General cancellation of longitudinal 
diamagnetic and paramagnetic currents: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/r1qVBGBt1l 

**Spin susceptibility and problem set 10**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/H1BhlIZ_kx

**Interacting spin susceptibility, ladder diagrams, bubble diagrams and problem set 12**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/HyisdIrOJx
