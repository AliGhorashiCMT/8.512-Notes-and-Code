# General description 

This folder will contain links to solutions to Professor Patrick Lee's problem sets from when he taught the class in 2009. The problem sets 
themselves may be found here: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-512-theory-of-solids-ii-spring-2009/pages/assignments/


## Problem set solutions: 
**Problem set 4 solutions**: https://hackmd.io/@aligho/rk_8fsNSJe (Derivation of conductivity in the Boltzmann and Kubo formalisms, discussion of Kramers-Kronig
relations, conductivity in the small and large mean free path regimes, derivation of Kubo formula from Fermi's golden rule).
