# 8.512-Notes-and-Code

## General description
This repository contains notes and code used (by me, Ali Ghorashi) during the Sprng 2025 semester of 8.512 (Theory of Solids II) at MIT. Problem set solutions are provided as hackmd documents. 
These solutions will be made private after the completion of the Spring term (maybe). 

## Folder structure 
The folder structure is somewhat different from that of the 8.511 repository. Instead of delineating folders by topics, they are, instead, primarily delineated chronologically (separated by week). The reason for this is that some topics don't fit nicely into a given category and having many small folders for subtopics becomes cumbersome (for instance, you could imagine categorizing Landau diamagnetism as a subtopic of linear response, quantum oscillations, quantum geometry, magnetism, etc...). There are a few exceptions to this general rule, described below

**Week 2**: Includes **HW1** solutions. HW1 deals with Bosonic and Fermionic creation and annihilation operators, in particular their properties under basis transformations (relevant in e.g. diagonalizing tight binding
Hamiltonians).

**Week 3**: 

**Week 4**: Includes **HW2** and **HW4** solutions. HW2 involves topics related to superfluidity: deriving the Gross-Pitaevski equation, obtaining an order-of-magnitude estimate for the critical velocity of superfluid flow. HW4 involves topics related to superconductiviy and is the first of three problem sets that concern superconductivity. HW4 covers the London equations--deriving them from the diamagnetic current density as well as from the Landau-Ginzburg formalism. 

**Week 5**: Includes **HW5** solutions. 

**week_after_cleo**: Includes **HW10**, **HW11**, **HW12** solutions. HW10 covers the Peierls instability (also covered in 8.511 notes) and Brownian motion. HW11 covers the Kramers-Kronig relations as well as sum rules derived from these relations. HW12 covers applications of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. 

**week_after_writing_dissertation**: Includes **HW8** and **HW9** solutions. HW8 covers classical and quantum polarizabilities and Friedel oscillations at zero and non-zero temperatures. HW9 covers plasmons and magnetoplasmons (surface magnetoplasmons in 3D and edge magnetoplasmons in 2D).  

 **old pset solutions**: Solutions to 8.512 problem sets used in previous years (when Patrick Lee taught the class). 
 
 **kittel solutions**: Solutions to a selection of problems from Kittel's book. Primarily used for examples during recitations.
