# 8.512-Notes-and-Code

## General description
This repository contains notes and code used (by me, Ali Ghorashi) during the Sprng 2025 semester of 8.512 (Theory of Solids II) at MIT. Problem set solutions are provided as hackmd documents. 
These solutions will be made private after the completion of the Spring term (maybe). 

## Folder structure 
The folder structure is somewhat different from that of the 8.511 repository. Instead of delineating folders by topics, they are, instead, primarily delineated chronologically (separated by week). The reason for this is that some topics don't fit nicely into a given category and having many small folders for subtopics becomes cumbersome (for instance, you could imagine categorizing Landau diamagnetism as a subtopic of linear response, quantum oscillations, quantum geometry, magnetism, etc...). There are a few exceptions to this general rule, described below

 **old pset solutions**: Solutions to 8.512 problem sets used in previous years (when Patrick Lee taught the class). 
 
 **kittel solutions**: Solutions to a selection of problems from Kittel's book. Primarily used for examples during recitations.
